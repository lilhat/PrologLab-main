% Code for an Expert System Shell: 
 
% See Bratko pages 353-356. 
%  
% The code below is for the expert system shell. This is the shell that you need to use 
% to write your own expert system; that is, your task will be to write the rules 
% which use the shell. Get the shell running in Prolog and test using Bratkoâ€™s 
% examples. 
% 
% Interaction with user and why and how explanation 
 
% Operators for easy to read rules.

% Negation-as-failure cannot be used in this context because of the closed-world assumption in Prolog.
% In Prolog, if something is not known to be true, it is assumed to be false. So, if we have a rule that 
% says "You are not infected if you did not go to a large party and a person at the party tested positive,"
% Prolog would assume that you are not infected if it does not know whether you went to the party or not, 
% which is not necessarily true. To avoid this problem, we need to include negated expressions in the Prolog 
% predicates explicitly.
